1) data pre-processing : [ lemmatization, remove blank spaces, lower case, stop words]

2)Tokenize the sentence : covert sentence into token and give index according to frequency (Ex: if the is highest frequnet word then index of "The" will be lowest means may be 1..so according to frquencey . give index

3)pad-sequence(we have to give this sequence to nural network,fixed size of sequence is needed.) for that try to apply padding and truncating to the sentence.


4)split x and y ...but y should be one - hot encode. So, it can predict next word.

5)apply machine learning algoritham to train the model.(LSTM or bidirectional LSTM)
   1)use Embedding layer as first layer
